# Data Honors Thesis

I will be working with Professor Friedrich Sommer in the Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience & Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute and my project will be extension of a current project being done in Prof. Sommerâ€™s lab -- understanding how the location of rats in a given area can be deciphered from hippocampal activity by detecting the firing of individual place-selective neurons and analyzing different signals produced by this area of the brain and extending this analysis to slightly more complicated animals such as bats. This work is important because the approach used to correlated position with signals in the hippocampus area can be applied more generally to decipher information from coherent population activity in other parts of the brain.
